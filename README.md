# YorkU WebRing

## What is the YorkU Webring?

The YorkU WebRing is a network of student-created websites that link to one another in a loop, allowing visitors to easily navigate between personal pages, portfolios, projects, and clubs. Each site in the ring includes simple “previous / next / random” navigation links, creating a connected community of YorkU voices on the web.  The YorkU WebRing provides a platform for students to showcase their portfolios, projects, and other creative work, which makes it easy for professors, other students and even potential employers easy access to all of this information.  Graduated and current students as well as professors are welcome to join the ring,   Each site in the ring can benefit from shared traffic as visitors move through the loop of connected pages, and helps visitors find new, relevant websites easily without relying solely on search engines.

## Why should I join the YorkU WebRing?

As time goes on, there is an increasing benefit to having your own website to demonstrate your abilities, experience, and education.  Especially when it comes to Art, Engineering, and many more, personal websites showcase your practical abilities and worked on projects, providing concrete examples of your knowledge that a resume simply cannot.  

Joining the YorkU WebRing means connecting with 100's of other York University students, which could give you the edge in the application process.  For example, employers could be impressed by one your fellow students, and may be interested in hiring other like-minded individuals in your program or those who graduated in the same year.

## How to join the YorkU WebRing?

For now, please email **tnewman057@gmail.com** or **newman06@my.yorku.ca** with your name, email, website, your program of study, your graduation year, the degree level you reached (Bachelor, Master, Doctorate) and a 130x40px banner (as decoration).  Upon approval, you will promptly be added to the webring.  Also, submitting a pull request may be possible, but is reviewed less often.

A more formal way of joining the WebRing will be provided in the future.

## Requirements for joining the YorkU WebRing

To join the WebRing, you must simply be a current or previous student of York University.  Please note that all members should have a working website at the time of application. Websites in development are also acceptable, but should be completed in the months following the acceptance into the WebRing.  Inactive or out of date websites may be removed at YorkU's discretion.  Websites should hopefully use a custom domain name (firstnamelastname.ca, etc.), but free domain names such as github.io are acceptable if you are planning on getting a custom domain name.

In an effort to reduce the amount of template/website builders in the WebRing, engineering students as well as Computer Science students are not allowed to submit these kinds of websites.  As an act of courtesy and understanding, other degrees may be accepted into the ring using these kinds of websites, but custom websites are still preferred.
